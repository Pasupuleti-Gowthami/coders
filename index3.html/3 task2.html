<p>Support and fan following
    The Super Kings have a large fan following across India, colloquially referred to as "Yellow Army".[109][110] The team has an official fan club called the "Whistle Podu Army" which was founded in January 2016 after the team's suspension from IPL.[111] In 2018 and 2019, there were reports of over 10,000 fans turning up to watch the team's practice sessions.[112] After the team's home games were moved to Pune in 2018, the Super Kings management arranged a charter train between Chennai and Pune, as well as free accommodation, for more than 1,000 fans of the team.[113][114]
    
    Brand value
    Chennai Super Kings was adjudged by Brand Finance to be the most valuable brand at US$65 million after the completion of 2018 IPL.[115] The Economic Times commissioned UK-based Brand Finance to carry out brand evaluation of the IPL and also each of the eight franchise teams (that was increased to 10 in 2011). Chennai Super Kings was rated as the "most valuable team" in the Indian Premier League in 2010–11, with a brand value of $100 million (approximately ₹2.24 billion).[116] In February 2013, London based Brand Finance evaluated the top 150 most valuable teams in the world, in which Chennai Super Kings is placed in the 147th place valued at $46 million, just behind the Mumbai Indians.[117] In October 2021, Chennai Super Kings was valued at $900 million on track to become the first sports unicorn from India.[118]
    
    Controversies
    Ownership of N. Srinivasan
    Until September 2008, BCCI regulation, Clause 6.2.4 stated that "No administrator could have, directly or indirectly, any commercial interest in the matches or events conducted by the board". However, N. Srinivasan, who was then the treasurer and vice-chairman of BCCI, became the de facto owner of the Chennai Super Kings since he was the managing director of India Cements. Former BCCI President A. C. Muthiah wrote to the BCCI regarding the violation of this clause in 2008 but the BCCI did not respond. In September 2008, Muthiah went to the Madras High Court to restrain BCCI from allowing Srinivasan to participate in the general body meeting where the election was to be held. However, the suit was dismissed by the High Court and the following day, Srinivasan was elected as the Secretary of BCCI.[119] The clause was amended as "No administrator shall have, directly or indirectly, any commercial interest in any of the events of the BCCI, excluding IPL, Champions League and Twenty20".[120] Muthiah then moved to the Supreme Court which gave a split verdict in April 2011. Later in August 2011, Muthiah filed another petition to stop Srinivasan from taking over as the BCCI President[121] but the Supreme Court rejected the petition, and Srinivasan was elected the President of BCCI.[122]
    
    In 2011, the owners of other teams were concerned about the possible rigging that could have taken place in the IPL auctions. Nita Ambani, the owner of Mumbai Indians questioned the changing order of players just before the auction began.[123] Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi accused Srinivasan of arm-twisting him and rigging the 2009 IPL auction to ensure that English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was bought by the Chennai Super Kings while it was refuted by Srinivasan.[124]
    
    2013 betting scandal
    Further information: 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing and betting case
    In May 2013, Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of Srinivasan, was arrested by Mumbai Police on charges of placing bets on IPL matches.[125] Meiyappan, who was the Team Principal of the Super Kings, was issued a summons by the Mumbai Police and on interrogation it was found that Meiyappan was in contact with bookies through actor Vindu Dara Singh.[126] Mumbai police arrested Meiyappan for betting offence.[127] Following this, Srinivasan, on 2 June 2013, decided to step aside as BCCI President temporarily until the inquiry into the betting case is completed.[128] In February 2014, the three-member panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India enquired into the betting case, and indicted Meiyappan for illegal betting during the 2013 IPL.[129]
    
    IPL suspension
    See also: Lodha Committee
    On 25 March 2014, the Supreme Court of India issued an ultimatum to the Board of Control for Cricket in India demanding that Srinivasan either step down as president or be removed from his position.[130] On 14 July 2015, the RM Lodha Committee suspended the owners of Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings from the Indian Premier League for a period of two years.[3] On 24 February 2016, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a plea for lifting the ban on the Chennai Super Kings.</p>
