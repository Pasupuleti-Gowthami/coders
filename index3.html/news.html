    <p>A LEGAL battle between the Monterey Peninsula
        Water Management District and a county agency over the
        operation of the Peninsula’s water system took another
        turn last week when the agency appealed a December
        2023 court ruling.
        In early 2022, the seven-member Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County rejected an application by the water district to become a retail water provider
        so it could take over and operate California American Water’s Monterey system. That decision prompted
        the water district in April 2022 to file a lawsuit against
        LAFCO alleging, among other things, that it violated key
        provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act
        and state law, and that several board members were biased
        in their decision</p>
